## Consensus sequences for U.S. H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b

BioProject: [PRJNA1102327](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA1102327)

Consensus genomes for 8 segments were generated with `EPI_ISL_19032063` (source: GISAID) as a reference using [iVar v1.4.2](https://github.com/andersen-lab/ivar). Minimum depth was set at 1, minimum quality at 20, and the consensus threshold at 50%.

The consensus genomes are in [./fasta/](./fasta).

The metadata from SRA is in [./metadata/](./metadata).

Alignments of individual segments are in [./alignments/](./alignments).

For NextStrain-style formatted version of the genomes and associated metadata,  please see [https://github.com/moncla-lab/avian-flu-USDA-cattle/](https://github.com/moncla-lab/avian-flu-USDA-cattle/).
